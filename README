Here are the instructions to run the code and get your thermoelectric data.

You have to give correct path for pseudopotential file, executable of Quantum espresso, and executable of BoltzTraP in job.sh file.  
Pseudopotential path will contain the path of your psedopotential file where it is located. If you download the psedopotential file
from this link  https://www.materialscloud.org/discover/sssp/table/precision, you give the path of psedopotential file which is inside
it.

Path of Quantum espresso executble will contains its all executable like pw.x, band.x etc.
i.e. path_of_quatum_espresso_installation_folder/bin/

Path of BoltzTraP executable will contain its BoltzTraP executable. 
i.e. path_of_BoltzTraP_installation_folder/src/

After giveing accurate path you have to run following command
$ bash job.sh

To plot your output, use the following command
all.gp is a gnuplot file to plot seeback constant, electrical conductivity per tau, thermal conductivity per tau, and power factor.
Here is the format to run this file generally.
gnuplot -c all.gp path_of_Boltz.trace_file  fermi_enery_in_Ry  range_of_enery_from_E_fermi initial_temp final_temp temp_range

Here, fermi energy in Rydberg can be extracted by this command in terminal
head -3 Boltz.intrans | tail -1 | awk '{print $1}'
it will give  E_fermi= 0.492903980096 

Here, range of energy from fermi energy is 0.15. So it will plot E_fermi-15 Ry to E_fermi+15 Ry.

Temperature range you can select according to your choice, but it will be better to plot 8 plots at a time. 

$ gnuplot -c all.gp boltz/Boltz.trace 0.492903980096 0.15 100 800 100

If you job runs successfully, you will get the results like the results given in the results folder.
